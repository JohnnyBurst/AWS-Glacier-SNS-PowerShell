** Active AWS account with Glacier/SNS, AWS Access Key ID, AWS Secret Access Key credentials from https://portal.aws.amazon.com/gp/aws/securityCredentials

INSTALL:
** Download glacier_cmdlets.psm1. From a PowerShell command window, run the following: Import-Module <path to glacier_cmdlets.psm1>
** You may also add the Import-Module command to your $PROFILE to auto-load the module when you open a PowerShell command window.

CMDLET HELP:
** You can view all the cmdlets in the module by running this: (Get-Module glacier_cmdlets).ExportedCommands
** You can also view individual cmdlet help by running: Get-Help <cmdlet>. The usual parameters apply, -detailed, -full, -examples

TROUBLESHOOTING:
** The AWS SDK for .NET requires administrator privileges to install. See http://aws.amazon.com/releasenotes/4380692763733545 for more information, and change the path to the DLL using the procedure below.
** The cmdlet expects that the SDK DLL is in the default installation path for Windows 7 (%PROGRAMFILES(x86)%\AWS SDK for .NET\bin\AWSSDK.dll) or the default installation path for Windows XP (%PROGRAMFILES%\AWS SDK for .NET\bin\AWSSDK.dll). If it hasn't been installed to the default location, please comment out lines 54-59 in glacier_cmdlets.psm1 by appending a # to the beginning of each of those lines. Add a new line with the following command: Add-Type -Path "<path>\AWS SDK for .NET\bin\AWSSDK.dll"
** This cmdlet is unsigned; if PowerShell complains about the execution policy on your machine, run the following command to set the execution policy to Unrestriced (providing you are comfortable with doing so, and understand the potential risk): Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted
** Changing PowerShell execution policy requires administrator privileges. Additionally, see http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee176961.aspx for more information on PowerShell's ExecutionPolicy.
